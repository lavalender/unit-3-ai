    "##### Question 00\n",
    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** LLMs are AI that learn from very large amounts of data that generates human-like text through having mutlitple neural networks. It is different from traditional software because it typically run on explicitly coded rules and logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:**  A prompt is an input to help to develop the model's output. Prompting is important becuase that's the way that the AI runs and knows what tasks it should carry out. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:**Some prompting techniques are zero shot prompting, few shot pattern, chain of thought, meta prompting, and overall just being specific. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior is that it can get too biased due to the information that you provide it and also it get be inaccurate. "
